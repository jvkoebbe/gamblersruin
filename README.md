# Gamblersruin Webpage

This repository contains a version of the Gambler's Ruin Java Applet from a long time ago. This object oriented class was written
by [Joe Koebbe](https://www.github.com/jvkoebbe) as part of a teaching unit for a course entitled Math 4620 Computer Aided
Mathematics for Secondary Mathematics Teachers. The idea was to present an example of a mathematical modeling problem with a
closed form analytic solution for the problem.

The code is self-contained, written in Java. All you need is a relatively new version of a Java compiler. The graphical user
interface displays textfields for input and output. This webpage documents how a user can interact with the code once you have
it compiled and running. There are also some basic instructions on how to download the code, compile the code (if necessary),
and run the GUI.
