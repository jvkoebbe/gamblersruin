# Gamblers Ruin Repository

This repository contains a version of the Gambler's Ruin Java Applet from a long time ago. This object oriented class was written
by [Joe Koebbe](http://www.math.usu.edu/~koebbe/) as part of a teaching unit for a course entitled Math 4620 Computer Aided
Mathematics for Secondary Mathematics Teachers.
